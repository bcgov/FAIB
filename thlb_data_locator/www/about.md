# **Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB) Data**
THLB Data is produced for each Timber Supply Area (TSA) in the province through the Timber Supply Review (TSR) process.

The THLB is an estimate of the land where timber harvesting is considered both acceptable and economically feasible, given the objectives for all relevant forest values, existing timber quality, market values and applicable technology. It is a theoretical, strategic-level estimate used for timber supply analysis and could include areas that may never be harvested or may exclude areas that will be harvested.

A THLB dataset is created for a given TSA upon the completion of a TSR by the provincial Chief Forester. The THLB best reflects the final conditions decided upon by the Chief Forester in determining the Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) for a given unit.

NOTE: THLB data for most area-based tenures (i.e. Tree Farm Licenses, Woodlots, Community Forests Agreements and First Nation Woodland Licenses) are NOT included in this dataset. Some area-based tenures that have been established within areas that were previously part of a TSA may show the THLB used for the most recent TSR.
